ShopBunny doesn't taste like chicken.

=== Installation
1. Running the generator
  Currently ShopBunny needs a "Cart" model in the host application.
  You can install both plus all necessary migrations and an initializerusing the generator:
    rails generate shop_bunny:install

2. Mounting the app
  Add this to your routes file:
    mount ShopBunny::Engine => '/'
  You can access the shopping cart at '/cart'

3. Setup you "Item" class
  A Cart has man "items". To setup the class of "item" to "Product" you'd have to set the following inside
  'config/initializers/shop_bunny, which was installed by the generator above:
    config.item_model_class_name = 'Product'
