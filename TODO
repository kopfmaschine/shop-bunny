- Don't make the host app need to create Cart model
- Add request tests
- Add generator tests
- Make Cart have many polymorphic items, so you don't have to setup config.item_model_class_name
- Because ShopBunny.table_name_prefix is blank the app also works with 
  a 'coupons' table instead of 'shop_bunny_coupons'. This does not look very "black box", not sure if we should change this. 
- Merge migrations into one (as long we are alpha)
- Better README
- How to customize the controller?
- How to customize the routes?
- Make ORM agnostic
