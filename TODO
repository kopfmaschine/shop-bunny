- Don't create a Cart for every new session. Only store the cart when adding items/coupons.
- Don't make the host app need to create Cart model. Add ShopBunny::Cart.
- The behaviour for Coupon#bonus_article_id is not used. Either spec and implement or remove.
- Make Cart have many polymorphic items, so you don't have to setup config.item_model_class_name
- Add generator tests.
- Because ShopBunny.table_name_prefix is blank the app also works with 
  a 'coupons' table instead of 'shop_bunny_coupons'. This does not look very "black box", not sure if we should change this. 
- Merge migrations into one (as long we are alpha)
- Better README
- How to customize the controller?
- Rename "discount_credit" to "credit" and "discount_percentage" to "discount" (Improve the API)
